# Final Recommendations

## UX & Website Optimization
**Don't Touch the Checkout Flow**  
Conversion from *Checkout Start* to *Purchase* sits at an excellent **80%**.  
**Action:** Avoid redesigning the checkout page—you risk disrupting what's working perfectly.

## Marketing Strategy
**Reduce Overinvestment in Social**  
Social drives **30% of traffic** but has the lowest conversion (mostly "window shoppers").  
**Action:** Shift from traffic campaigns to **retargeting** or **lead generation** for emails.

**Double Down on Email**  
Email converts at **13%+** (vs 6% social).  
**Actions:** Add email capture popups for social visitors. Once captured, your data shows these users are far more likely to purchase later through email campaigns.

## Financial & Revenue
**Audit Ad Spend vs AOV**  
Average Order Value: **$108**.  
**Actions:** Set a clear and strict Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) limit of $30–$40 per customer.
If social media ads exceed that CAC range—given their lower conversion—it’s likely those transactions will lose money.
