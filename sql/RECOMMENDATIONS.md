Final Recommendations


UX & Website Optimization
Don’t Touch the Checkout Flow
Conversion from Checkout Start to Purchase sits at an excellent 80%, indicating a smooth, frictionless payment process.
Action: Avoid redesigning or adjusting the checkout page at this time—you risk breaking something that works well. 
Marketing Strategy
Reduce Overinvestment in Social for Sales
Social media drives 30% of overall traffic, but has the lowest conversion efficiency, attracting mostly “window shoppers.”
Action: Shift budget away from traffic-focused campaigns and prioritize retargeting or lead generation to capture email leads instead.
Double Down on Email Marketing
Email remains the highest-converting channel at 13%+, compared to only 6% from social.
Actions:
Add a high-visibility email capture popup, especially targeting visitors from social channels.
Once captured, your data shows these users are far more likely to purchase later through email campaigns.
Financial & Revenue
Audit Ad Spend vs. Average Order Value (AOV)
Current AOV: $108.
Actions:
Set a clear and strict Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) limit of $30–$40 per customer.
If social media ads exceed that CAC range—given their lower conversion—it’s likely those transactions will lose money.
